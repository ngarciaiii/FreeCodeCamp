			<section><p> Bruce Wayne is the only child of a wealthy family that had greatly contributed to Gotham City. Third of buildings in Gotham City are owned by or under Wayne Enterprises. His father Dr. Thomas Wayne was a millionaire/billionaire industrialist and was dedicated in working as a doctor. Bruce's mother Martha Wayne was a socialite, always involved with charities. <img src= "file:///Users/nicolas/Documents/Programming/FreeCodeCamp/Project_1/img/pic1.jpg" align="right" class="smaller-image margin-top margin-sides black-border"><p>When Bruce Wayne was 8 year old, his parents were killed before his eyes by a petty thief in the alley. The alley later became infamously known as the "crime alley". It turned Bruce's life upside-down. He sworn a revenge. From that day, he is no longer Bruce Wayne.</p><img src="file:///Users/nicolas/Documents/Programming/FreeCodeCamp/Project_1/img/bwoverachiever.jpg" align="left" class="smaller-image margin-sides black-border"><p>The fire drives him to be an overachiever at nearly everything. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. He mastered science and criminology. He pushed his body physically to the perfection.</p><p>He went on training abroad, learning the secret martial arts, and developed skills in manhunting. He returned to Gotham City at age of twenty-five. He was ready to fight crimes at night as a lone vigilante. His first night, he wore make ups and scar as a disguise and wasn't successful. He tried three holes full face mask another time and it didn't work out well. Criminals and thugs were not afriad of him. After close calls of life and death situations, he was about to give up. At that night Bruce Wayne was back at home in Wayne Manor, injuried with a gunshot wound. He asked his deceased father Thomas on what he can do. A bat flew through into the room, shattered the window. Batman was born.</p></section><img src="file:///Users/nicolas/Documents/Programming/FreeCodeCamp/Project_1/img/mesh.jpg" class="smaller-image center-image margin-top black-border">
